## Executing the Ansible Playbook:

Place the yaml file [ansible_playbook_HW5.yml](https://github.ncsu.edu/yvora/HW5/blob/master/ansible_playbook_HW5.yml) having all the ansible setups and client configs in the home directory of the ansible server and run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory --sudo ansible_playbook_HW5.yml
```


## Output:

```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ansible-playbook -i inventory --sudo ansible_playbook_HW5.yml
[DEPRECATION WARNING]: The sudo command line option has been deprecated in favor of the "become" command line arguments. This feature will be removed in version 2.6. Deprecation
warnings can be disabled by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.

Based on the Setup, the application is deployed on the **Port: 3003** and the IP for the node or configured client is: **192.168.21.22**. Hence, once the setup is complete successfully, the application can be accessed using: **192.168.21.22:3003**

## Concepts

**1. Why should developers use configuration management tools to manage their software programs? What can go wrong?**

Configuration management (CM) is concerned with the policies, processes and tools to manage changing software systems. CM is also very important as it is quite easy to lose track of what changes and component versions have been added in every release and also essential for team projects to control changes made by different developers. 
Software configuration tools on a high level help the software developers in achieving the following:
* **identification**, required to identify the current configuration;
* **control**, tools that help to change the configuration;
* **status accounting**, tools that identify the current status of the configuration, which is a highly important feature in a development environment; and
* **auditing**, ensuring the developer to verify that a configuration contains the required components.

To elaborate more on the above discussed points, automated CM tools can help to:
* Record, control, and correlate Configuration Items (CIs), Configuration Units (CUs), and Configuration Components (CCs) within several individual baselines across the life cycle.
* Identify and control baselines.
* Track, control, manage, and report requests for changes to the baseline CIs, CCs, and CUs.
* Track requirements from specification to testing.
* Identify and control software versions.
* Track hardware parts.
* Enable rigorous compliance with a robust CM process.
* Conduct Physical Configuration Audits (PCAs).
* Facilitate the conduct of Functional Configuration Audits.

One such application of CM tools is the Agile development, where components and systems are changed several times per day and it is almost impossible to manage without CM tools.

Some things that need to be taken care of or somethings that can go wrong with CM tools include:
* Almost everyone is familiar with CM, but relevant training is always required to orient staff on how to use the tool based on the company's standard of CM
* The CM tools should be able to coordinate with those responsible for business continuity in case of a disaster as it is easily assumed by the team members that the CM tool will provide support for this which is quite not safe unless the CM tools are designed to handle this.
* Automated CM tools may be able to handle one area well, but may not be suitable for the other. Hence, proper Integration support between these CM tools is really important.
* The initial and longer term costs, including licenses, and labor cost to install and develop it so it is usable for your program should be considered before buying any CM tool. Also, the on-going system administration, security, maintenance, back up, and recovery as well as business continuity of operation and disaster recovery should be taken into account while buying.
* The tool should be able to transition from one contractor to another, which is sometimes the case when a program transitions from production to sustainment.



**2. Explain the difference between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, in your own words.**

Continuous integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Continuous Delivery share the same goal of making our software development and release process faster and more robust. The sole difference between the three is in the scope of automation applied. 

Continuous Integration (CI) lets developers prevent many issues before they reach users and ship code with more confidence, but relatively slow. The deployment process may still be manual, long, and error-prone. Developers must get CI results within 10 minutes, otherwise their productivity shrinks due to lack of focus and frequent context switching. An easy way to optimize CI time is to run tests in parallel on a powerful platform.

Continuous Delivery (CD) on the other hand is a practice of automating the entire software release process. The idea here is to perform CI, and additionally automate the preparation and tracking of a release to production.

Continuous Deployment is the CI + CD + fully automated deployment to production. It is a step up from CD in which every change in the source code is deployed to production automatically, without explicit approval from a developer. Once the code is merged to the master by the developer,  a CI/CD service basically runs all the tests and deploy the code to production, while keeping the team updated about the results of every important event. Continuous deployment also requires serious monitoring, being on call, and having the capacity to recover quickly which makes it a little difficult practice to follow. 

It is quite possible to apply Continuous Delivery to the entire system or even organization but, similar is not the case with the  continuous integration and deployment since CD is a more loose concept than the other two.
